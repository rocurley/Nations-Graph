# Work yet to be done

* More advanced tutorial-style documentation

* TLS server certificate verification

* An example that spiders a Haddock package's docs to validate its
  internal and external links

* Integration with tagsoup (see
  [the mess in `UploadPaste.hs`](https://github.com/bos/wreq/blob/master/examples/UploadPaste.hs#L137))

* International domain support?

* Better authentication support, including session-long memory of
  which URLs do and don't need authentication

* Some poor sod needs to add digest authentication to `http-client` so
  we can use it

* Cache management
